# Running times
Function running times before optimization:

* Brute force (n=16): 29.6s
  
* Dynamic programming (n=500): 2.22s
  
* Greedy algorithm (n=1000000): 286ms

Function running times after optimization:

* Brute force (n = 16):
  
# Profiling insights:
In brute_force_knapsack() the rbind() function in the first version took up the most time.
The function was modified to intialize the element matrix and change each row instead of appending each row with rbind().
